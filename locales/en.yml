  images:
    new: Add images
    info: Store often used images here, to simplify PDF creation. Instead of uploading
      the same image for each new PDF(via API), just refer to the image using it's  filename
      or id. SAVE the Planet, prevent Traffic!
    new_info: <strong>We like JPG, TIFF, GIF and PNG's, with a maximum file size of
      4MB and NO special chars in filename!!! </strong><br/>Image placeholders(on
      templates) have settings for clipping, shrinking, etc, so images are always
      shown .. somehow. For best results, images should match the size of the fitbox
      and a have resolution of 300DPI. Keep in mind that big images will also blow
      up your PDF, so take your time and optimize your files.
  datasets:
    edit: Edit dataset
    name_info: give it a name, to identify the data
    info: Dataset's are saved on PDF creation. Re-used it for new PDF's by it's name
      or ID(via API) and only submit fields that differ.
